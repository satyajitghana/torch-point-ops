`torch-point-ops` provides efficient and well-tested implementations of common point cloud operations, designed to be easily integrated into any deep learning pipeline.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Chamfer Distance**: A fast and efficient implementation of the Chamfer Distance between two point clouds.
- **Earth Mover's Distance (EMD)**: An implementation of the Earth Mover's Distance for comparing point cloud distributions.
- **CUDA Support**: GPU-accelerated operations for high-performance computation.
- **Fully Tested**: Includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure correctness and reliability.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up `torch-point-ops` in a local development environment.

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.13
- PyTorch >= 2.7.1
- A C++17 compatible compiler
- A CUDA-enabled GPU
- `uv` for package management
- (Optional) `patchelf` >= 0.14 for building the wheel

### Installation from Source

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/satyajitghana/torch-point-ops.git
    cd torch-point-ops
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies using `uv`:**

    ```bash
    pip install uv
    uv pip install -e .[dev]
    ```
This command installs the library in editable mode, allowing you to modify the source code and see the changes immediately.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the Wheel

To create a distributable wheel, run the provided build script. This is useful for installing the package in other environments without needing to build from source every time.

```bash
bash scripts/build_wheel.sh
```

This script will:
1.  Install `patchelf` (if not already present).
2.  Build the wheel using `uv`.
3.  Repair the wheel with `auditwheel` to bundle the required shared libraries.

The final wheel will be located in the `dist/` directory.

## üí° Usage

Here's how you can use the Chamfer Distance and EMD functions in your project:

```python
import torch
from torch_point_ops.chamfer import chamfer_distance
from torch_point_ops.emd import earth_movers_distance

# Create two random point clouds on the GPU
p1 = torch.rand(1, 128, 3).cuda()
p2 = torch.rand(1, 128, 3).cuda()

# --- Chamfer Distance ---
dist1, dist2 = chamfer_distance(p1, p2)
loss = dist1.mean() + dist2.mean()
print(f"Chamfer Distance Loss: {loss.item()}")

# --- Earth Mover's Distance ---
emd_loss = earth_movers_distance(p1, p2)
print(f"Earth Mover's Distance Loss: {emd_loss.mean().item()}")
```

## ‚úÖ Running Tests

To ensure everything is working correctly, it is recommended to run the local test suite.

**Note**: These tests require a CUDA-enabled GPU to run.

```bash
pytest
```

This command will automatically discover and run all tests in the `tests/` directory.
