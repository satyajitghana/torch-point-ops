## üí° Usage

Here's how you can use the Chamfer Distance, EMD, and KNN functions in your project:

```python
import torch
from torch_point_ops.chamfer import chamfer_distance
from torch_point_ops.emd import earth_movers_distance
from torch_point_ops.knn import knn_points, KNearestNeighbors

# Create two random point clouds on the GPU
p1 = torch.rand(1, 128, 3).cuda()
p2 = torch.rand(1, 128, 3).cuda()

# --- Chamfer Distance ---
dist1, dist2 = chamfer_distance(p1, p2)
loss = dist1.mean() + dist2.mean()
print(f"Chamfer Distance Loss: {loss.item()}")

# --- Earth Mover's Distance ---
emd_loss = earth_movers_distance(p1, p2)
print(f"Earth Mover's Distance Loss: {emd_loss.mean().item()}")

# --- K-Nearest Neighbors ---
# Find 5 nearest neighbors from p2 for each point in p1
knn_result = knn_points(p1, p2, K=5, return_nn=True)
dists = knn_result.dists  # Shape: [1, 128, 5] - distances to nearest neighbors
idx = knn_result.idx      # Shape: [1, 128, 5] - indices of nearest neighbors
knn = knn_result.knn      # Shape: [1, 128, 5, 3] - coordinates of nearest neighbors

print(f"KNN distances shape: {dists.shape}")
print(f"Average distance to nearest neighbor: {dists[:, :, 0].mean().item()}")

# Using the KNearestNeighbors module for integration in neural networks
knn_module = KNearestNeighbors(K=5, return_nn=False).cuda()
dists, idx = knn_module(p1, p2)
```

## üöÄ Multi-Precision Support & Performance Optimizations

**torch-point-ops** stands out with its comprehensive multi-precision support and cutting-edge optimizations that most other point cloud libraries lack:

### üéØ Multi-Precision Support

Unlike other libraries that are limited to float32, **torch-point-ops** provides **native support** for all PyTorch floating-point types:

```python
import torch
from torch_point_ops.chamfer import chamfer_distance
from torch_point_ops.knn import knn_points

# Half precision (float16) - Perfect for memory-constrained environments
p1_half = torch.rand(1, 1024, 3, dtype=torch.float16).cuda()
p2_half = torch.rand(1, 1024, 3, dtype=torch.float16).cuda()

# Chamfer Distance with half precision
dist1, dist2 = chamfer_distance(p1_half, p2_half)

# KNN with half precision - up to 6x faster with optimized atomic operations
knn_result = knn_points(p1_half, p2_half, K=8)

# Single precision (float32) - Standard for most applications  
p1_single = torch.rand(1, 1024, 3, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()
p2_single = torch.rand(1, 1024, 3, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()
dist1, dist2 = chamfer_distance(p1_single, p2_single)
knn_result = knn_points(p1_single, p2_single, K=8)

# Double precision (float64) - For research requiring high numerical precision
p1_double = torch.rand(1, 1024, 3, dtype=torch.float64).cuda()
p2_double = torch.rand(1, 1024, 3, dtype=torch.float64).cuda()
dist1, dist2 = chamfer_distance(p1_double, p2_double)
knn_result = knn_points(p1_double, p2_double, K=8)
```

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

# Activate your environment first
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the FLOPs benchmark
python benchmark_flops.py
```

### üìà Performance Highlights

Based on benchmarking with an NVIDIA RTX 3090, here‚Äôs how `torch-point-ops` performs on a 1024x1024 point cloud configuration:

| Operation      | Precision | Mode    | Runtime (ms) | Speedup vs FP32 Eager | Notes                               |
|----------------|-----------|---------|--------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **KNN (K=16)** | FP32      | Eager   | 3.377        | 1.0x                  | Baseline performance                |
|                | **FP16**  | Eager   | **2.415**    | **1.4x**              | Faster with half precision          |
|                | **FP16**  | Compile | **4.582**    | **~0.7x**             | `torch.compile` overhead observed   |
| **Chamfer**    | FP32      | Eager   | 0.250        | 1.0x                  | Baseline performance                |
|                | **FP16**  | Eager   | **0.941**    | **~0.3x**             | Slower with half precision          |
|                | **FP16**  | Compile | **0.873**    | **~0.3x**             | `torch.compile` provides no benefit |
| **EMD**        | FP32      | Eager   | 11.126       | 1.0x                  | Baseline, FP16 not recommended      |
|                | FP32      | Compile | **10.107**   | **1.1x**              | `torch.compile` provides minor gains|

*Runtimes are for a single forward pass. Speedups are calculated relative to the FP32 Eager implementation.*

**Key Insights:**
- üöÄ **Optimized Kernels**: Our custom CUDA kernels for KNN and Chamfer are already highly optimized, showing that `torch.compile` may add overhead in some cases.
- ‚ö° **Half-Precision (FP16)**: For KNN, half-precision provides a solid **1.4x speedup** in eager mode, making it ideal for memory-constrained and performance-critical applications.
- üéØ **EMD**: EMD sees a minor benefit from `torch.compile`, while half-precision is not recommended due to numerical stability.
- üî• **GPU Scaling**: All operations show significant performance gains on larger inputs.
- üìä **Efficiency**: Optimized CUDA kernels deliver maximum hardware utilization, often outperforming generalized compilation approaches.

*The benchmark script tests various configurations and provides detailed timing statistics, theoretical FLOP counts, and performance analysis.*
